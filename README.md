Quickly install stuffs

# Installation
Super bad idea, don't install anything like this. I wrote this file, therefore I trust it.  

## Fedora Atomic Desktops
`wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdwv/linux-quick-setup/main/rpm-ostree_distros.sh | bash`

## Generic Distros (older)
`wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdwv/linux-quick-setup/main/linux-setup.sh | bash`
